# RAM Limiter
Limits Discord And Chromes Ram Usage (Selectable)


# Cause
This was made due to discord unnecessarily caching objects, this uses GC.Collect for garbage collection. Another cause to this was due to my laptop not having much ram and due to discord always using about 1.3GB of ram on my Gaming rig when i'm trying to play any ram intensive game.
This eliminates the use of Razer Cortexâ„¢ and or many other softwares.
Oh yeah also because the original owner of this is no longer maintaining it and is outdated by over a year.


# Use
Frees up RAM that is being used by Discord and Chrome Automatically, This gives your device more available ram and less battery consumption.
On startup you can choose between Chrome Or Discord Since those use the most ram for me personally.


# Original
No longer maintained, it used more CPU Than Discord Itself, Making it sacrifice free CPU for free RAM, In turn making it use more power.
